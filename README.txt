Algorithms, Computation and HCI - Studio at Srishti (2019)
----------------------------------------------------------
The theory formalizes the intuition that any design requires significant resources, by introducing mathematical models of computation to study its problems and quantifying the number of resources needed to solve them, such as time, storage and other relevant contextual parameters. Studying how efficiently problems can be solved on a model of computation, using an algorithm. What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers?
