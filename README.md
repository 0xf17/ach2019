# Algorithms, Computation and HCI - Studio at Srishti (2019)
The theory formalizes the intuition that any design requires significant resources, by introducing mathematical models of computation to study its problems and quantifying the number of resources needed to solve them, such as time, storage and other relevant contextual parameters. Studying how efficiently problems can be solved on a model of computation, using an algorithm. What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers?

## Assignment
TBA

## Assessment
Following are assessment criteria for this studio.

A1 is considered as the progress of assignment by end of the 3rd week (30% weight), 

A2 as the progress of assignment by end of 4th week (30% weight), and

A3 as the final paper assignment by the end of 5th week (40% weight).

Each of your assignment will be assessed on following capabilities and dimensions of practice.

### Capabilities
1. **Investigate / Research and analyze / HCD Capability (See and Connect):** The student recognizes and builds the relevance of specialized research methods to unearth insights of underlying algorithms that are not accessible up front. And is able to assess algorithms through amortized and/or asymptotic complexity. (Capability level - Intermediate)
2. **Synthesize and Envision / Patterns and Systems / HCD Capability (Discern and Align):** The student is able to understand the computational complexity and then derive actionable insights to identify areas where algorithms could be improved. (Capability level - Intermediate)
3. **Construct / Thinking and Construct meaning / HCD Capability (Make):** The student is able to build the description of the enhanced algorithm through both high level and implementation. (Capability level - Intermediate)

### Dimensions of Practice
1. **Informed Practice: Focus Area Knowledge:** The student has an understanding of the relevance of studying algorithms in designing systems, services, and products specifically that interface human and computers; methods of analyzing algorithmic/computational complexity through amortized and asymptotic approaches; Big O notation; models of computations; ways to express algorithms; computing impact factor of algorithms. (Capability level - Intermediate)
2. **Creative Practice: Navigating Complexity:** The student understands the behavior of algorithms, its inputs, outputs, and complex logic; and adopt different methodologies to analyze the algorithm to make sense of how it works and then brainstorm and design how an algorithm might be improved. (Capability level - Intermediate)
3. **Expansive Practice: Communication and Dissemination:** The student is able to extract, understand and express the algorithms and related context through different ways in which an algorithm can be communicated (ie. High-level description, Pseudocode and Flowcharts). Also, the student is able to clearly use mathematical notations to describe aspects of an algorithm wherever needed. (Capability level - Intermediate)
